I buiilt this API built using Node.js.
The API connects to a database on Atlas where users can search movies by title, genre, or director. Users can also store a list of favorite moves, as well as create and update a user profile. 
The app is hosted on Heroku. 
During the building process, I used Postman to test endpoints at key stages of code development.
