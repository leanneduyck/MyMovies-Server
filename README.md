I have developed a RESTful API using Node.js with Express and MongoDB for a movie database application. 
It sets up a server that exposes endpoints for performing CRUD operations on movies and users, including authentication (JWT) and validation (express-validator) mechanisms.
It also utilizes async/await for handling asynchronous operations. 
It is hosted on Heroku.
During the building process, I used Postman to test endpoints at key stages of code development.
