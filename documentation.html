      This app will provide users access to information about movies, directors,
      and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their profile, and
      create a list of favorite movies.

      In creating this app, I have used Node.js and the PowerShell to create the
      folder, as well as each file. I've used the built-in modules for http,
      url, and fs.
